The United States deeply appreciates the role Greece is playing in the war against terror. ... America and Greece are strong allies, and we're strategic partners.'';\rWhereas President Bush stated that Greece's successful ``law enforcement operations against a terrorist organization [November 17] responsible for three decades of terrorist attacks underscore the important contributions Greece is making to the global war on terrorism'';\rWhereas Greece is a strategic partner and ally of the United States in bringing political stability and economic development to the volatile Balkan region, having invested over $10,000,000,000 in the region;\rWhereas Greece was extraordinarily responsive to requests by the United States during the war in Iraq, as Greece immediately granted unlimited access to its airspace and the base in Souda Bay, and many ships of the United States that delivered troops, cargo, and supplies to Iraq were refueled in Greece;\rWhereas, in August 2004, the Olympic games came home to Athens, Greece, the land of their ancient birthplace 2,500 years ago and the city of their modern revival in 1896;\rWhereas Greece received world-wide praise for its extraordinary handling during the 2004 Olympics of over 14,000 athletes from 202 countries and over 2,000,000 spectators and journalists, which it did so efficiently, securely, and with its famous Greek hospitality;\rWhereas the unprecedented security effort in Greece for the first Olympics after the attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, included a record-setting expenditure of over $1,390,000,000 and assignment of over 70,000 security personnel, as well as the utilization of an 8-country Olympic Security Advisory Group that included the United States;\rWhereas Greece, located in a region where Christianity meets Islam and Judaism, maintains excellent relations with Muslim nations and Israel;\rWhereas the Government of Greece has had extraordinary success in recent years in furthering cross-cultural understanding and reducing tensions between Greece and Turkey;\rWhereas Greece and the United States are at the forefront of the effort for freedom, democracy, peace, stability, and human rights;\rWhereas those and other ideals have forged a close bond between these 2 nations and their peoples;\rWhereas March 25, 2006, marks the 185th anniversary of the beginning of the revolution that freed the Greek people from the Ottoman Empire; and\rWhereas it is proper and desirable to celebrate this anniversary with the Greek people and to reaffirm the democratic principles from which these 2 great nations were born: Now, therefore, be it\r)/Type/Annot/Subj(Correction To Page S2722)/Rect[98.017731 758.44873 164.484741 781.059326]/CreationDate(D:20070814060604-04'00')/NM(S6S5u0xHdQrriAP5yI726C)/Subtype/Square/C[0.0 0.0 0.0]/M(D:20070814060908-04'00')/P 274 0 R/T(August 1, 2007, Congressional Record)/Popup 282 0 R/AP<</N 283 0 R>>/RD[0.500153 0.500153 0.500153 0.500153]>>
